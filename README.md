# TFRRS-Scraper
Python script to scrape TFRRS.com, extracting data, parsing, cleaning, analyzing, and outputing short athlete-time profiles for athletes, coaches, and analysts to examine. In its current form, the program creates profiles for the top 25 110m Hurdlers in the Big West League, however with a few simple variable changes, users can extract times for any subset of athletes across event groups. This is a project I've become very passionate about and plan to come back to in the future to apply new skills and knowledge and expand the program's veritility and utility.
